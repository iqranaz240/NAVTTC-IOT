Let’s Start Building

The circuit is so simple and small, there are only a few connections to be made

Arduino Pins           Bluetooth Pins

RX (Pin 0)     ———->      TX

TX (Pin 1)      ———->      RX

5V                ———->      VCC

GND             ———->      GND

Connect a LED negative to GND of Arduino and positive to pin 13 with a resistance valued between 220Ω – 1KΩ. And you're done with the circuit

Pair your device with HC 05/06 Bluetooth module1) Turn ON HC 05/06 Bluetooth module2) Scan for available device3) Pair to HC 05/06 by entering default password 1234 OR 0000
Install  LED application on your android device
Open the Application
Press paired devices
Select your Bluetooth module from the List (HC 05)
After connecting successfully
Press ON button to turn ON LED and OFF button to turn OFF the LED
Disconnect button to disconnect from Bluetooth module

This is just a basic tutorial on interfacing Bluetooth module with Arduino This project can be improved to a higher level like Home automation using a smartphone, Smartphone controlled robot, and much more.
